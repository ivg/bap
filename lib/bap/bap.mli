      The {{!bfl}Foundation library} defines core types that are used
      throughout the BAP library for binary analysis. The
      {{!section:image}Memory model} layer is responsible for loading
      and parsing binary objects and representing them in memory. It
      also defines a few useful data structures that are used
      extensively by later layers. The next layer performs
      {{!section:disasm}disassembly} and lifting to BIL. Finally,
      the {{!section:sema}semantic analysis} layer transforms a
      binary into an IR representation, and further provides a set of
      handful analysis tools.

      Another important point of view is the BAP plugin architecture,
      similar to that of GIMP or Frama-C. BAP features a pluggable
      architecture with a number of extension points. For example,
      even the LLVM disassembler is considered a type of plugin.
      Currently we support three such extension points in BAP:

      - {{!Backend}loaders} - to add new binary object loaders;
      - disassemblers - to add new disassemblers;
      - {{!Project}program analysis} - to analyze programs.

      The latter category of plugins is most widely used. Therefore,
      when we use the term "plugin" without making a distinction, we
      refer to a program analysis plugin. The following figure
      provides an overview of the BAP system.

      All plugins have full access to the library; an important
      consequence is that they can and should open [Bap.Std]. The BAP
      library uses backend loader and disassembler plugins to provide
      its services. Program analysis plugins are loaded by BAP
      toolkit utilities. These utilities extend plugin functionality
      by providing access to the state of the target of analysis or,
      in our parlance, to the {{!project}project}. (See
      {!section:project}).

      Other than library itself, and the BAP toolkit, there are two
      additional libraries that are bundled with BAP:

      - [bap.plugins] to dynamically load code into BAP;
      - [bap.serialization] to serialize BAP data structures in
        different formats.
  *)


  (** {2:bfl Foundation Library}

      At this layer we define the core types that are tightly
      integrated with Binary Intermediate Language ({{!Bil}BIL}). The
      core types are:

      - {{!Arch}arch} - to denote computer architecture;
      - {{!Size}size} - to specify sizes of wors or addresses;
      - {{!Var}var}  - BIL variable;
      - {{!Type}typ} - OCaml type for BIL type;
      - {{!Exp}exp}  - BIL expression;
      - {{!Stmt}stmt} - BIL statement;
      - {{!Bitvector}word,addr} - a bitvector data structure
        to represent immediate data;
      - {{!Tag}'a tag} and {{!Tag}value} - an extensible variant type,
        aka existential, aka type [any];
      - {{!Seq}'a seq} - slightly extended Core [Sequence], aka lazy
        list.

      Every type implements the {{!Regular}Regular} interface. This
      interface is very similar to Core's [Identifiable], and is
      supposed to represent a type that is as common as a built-in
      type. One should expect to find any function that is
      implemented for such types as [int], [string], [char], etc.
      Namely, this interface includes:

      - comparison functions: ([<, >, <= , >= , compare, between, ...]);
      - each type defines a polymorphic [Map] with keys of type [t];
      - each type provides a [Set] with values of type [t];
      - hashtable is exposed via [Table] module;
      - hashset is available under [Hash_set] name
      - sexpable and binable interface;
      - [to_string], [str], [pp], [ppo], [pps] functions
      for pretty-printing.

      Most types usually provide much more. For each type, there is a
      module with the same name that implements its interface. For
      example, type [exp] is indeed a type abbreviation for [Exp.t],
      and module [Exp] contains all functions and types related to 
      type [exp]. For example, to create a hashtable of statements,
      just type:

      [let table = Stmt.Table.create ()]

      If a type is a variant type (i.e., defines constructors) then for
      each constructor named [Name], there exists a corresponding
      function named [name] that will accept the same number of
      arguments as the arity of the constructor. For example, a
      [Bil.Int] can be constructed with the [Bil.int] function that
      has type [word -> exp]. If a constructor has several arguments
      of the same type we usually disambiguate them with keywords,
      e.g., [Bil.Load of (exp,exp,endian,size)] has function
      {{!Bil.load}Bil.load} with type: 
      [mem:exp -> addr:exp -> endian -> size -> exp]


      {3:tries Tries}

      The Foundation library also defines a prefix tree data
      structure that proves useful for binary analysis applications.
      {{!module:Trie}Trie}s in BAP is a functor that derives a
      polymorphic trie data structure for a given
      {{!modtype:Trie.Key}Key}.

      For convenience we support instantiating tries for most of
      our data structures. For example, {{!Bitvector}Word} has several
      {{!Bitvector.Trie}tries} inside.

      For common strings, there's {!Trie.String}.
  *)

  (** {2:image Memory model}

      This layer provides everything you need to work with binary
      objects:

      - {{!Memory}mem} - a contiguous array of bytes, indexed with
       absolute addresses;

      - {{!Table} 'a table} - a mapping from a memory regions to
       arbitrary data (no duplicates or intersections);

      - {{!Memmap}a memmap} - a mapping from memory region to
        arbitrary data with duplicates and intersections allowed, aka
        segment tree or interval map;

      - {{!Image}image} - represents a binary object with all its
       symbols, sections and other meta information.

      The [Image] module uses the plugin system to load binary
      objects. In order to add new loader, one should implement the
      {{!Backend}Backend.t} loader function and register it with the
      {{!Image.register_backend}Image.register_backend} function. *)


  (** {2:disasm Disassembler}

      This layer consists of disassemblers and lifters. They are
      tightly integrated, but in general we can disassemble all
      supported {{!Arch.t}architectures}. Currently we lift only arm,
      x86 and x86_64.


      There are two interfaces to disassemblers:

      - {{!Disasm}Disasm} - a regular interface that hides all
       complexities, but may not always be very flexible.
      - {{!Disasm_expert}Disasm_expert} - an expert interface that
      provides access to a low-level representation. It is very
      flexible and fast, but harder to use.

      To disassemble files or data with the regular interface, use
      one of the following functions:

      - {{!disassemble}disassemble} - to disassemble a region of
        memory;
      - {{!disassemble_image}disassemble_image} - to disassemble a
        loaded binary object;
      - {{!disassemble_file}disassemble_file} or
        {{!disassemble_file_exn}disassemble_file} - to disassemble
        file.

      All these functions perform disassembly by recursive descent,
      reconstruct the control flow graph, and perform lifting. The
      result of disassembly is represented by the abstract value of
      type {{!Disasm}disasm}. Two main data structures that are used
      to represent disassembled program are:

      - {{!Insn}insn} - a machine instruction;
      - {{!Block}block} - a basic block, i.e., a linear sequence of
        instructions.

      The following figure shows the relationship between basic data
      structures of the disassembled program.

        | +-------------+ |
        +-----------------+
      ]}


      A disassembled program is represented as a set of
      interconnected {{!Block}basic blocks}. You can navigate between
      blocks using {{!Block_traverse.succs}Block.succs} and
      {{!Block_traverse.preds}Block.preds} functions, or you can
      transform a set of blocks into a real {{!Block.Cfg}graph} using
      the {{!Block.to_graph}Block.to_graph} function. Sometimes it
      is enough to traverse program using 
      {{!Block.dfs}depth-first search}.

      Each block is a container to a sequence of machine
      instructions. It is guaranteed that there's at least one
      instruction in the block, thus the
      {{!Block_accessors.leader}Block.leader} and
      {{!Block_accessors.terminator}Block.terminator} functions are
      total.

      Each {{!Insn}machine instruction} is represented by its
      [opcode], [name] and [array] of operands (these are machine and
      disassembler specific), a set of predicates (describing
      instruction semantics on a very high level), and a sequence of
      {{!Bil}BIL} statements that precisely define the semantics of
      the instruction.

      Modules of type {{!CPU}CPU} provide a high level abstraction of
      the CPU and allow one to reason about instruction semantics
      independently from the target platform. Modules of type
      {{!ABI}ABI} provide even more information, e.g., it maps
      registers to formals. The module type {{!Target}Target} brings
      [CPU] and [ABI] together. To get an instance of this module,
      you can use the {{!target_of_arch}target_of_arch} function. For
      accessing all information about target platform, use the
      following modules that expose low-level and platform-specific
      details:

      - {{!ARM}ARM}
      - {{!IA32}IA32}
      - {{!AMD64}AMD64}


      If you do not need cfg reconstruction, you can use
      {{!linear_sweep}linear_sweep} function to disassemble a given
      memory region. If you need more granularity, then you can use
      the expert interface accordingly:

      - {{!Disasm_expert.Basic}Basic} - provides access to a low-level
        disassembler on top of which all other disassemblers are
        built;
      - {{!Disasm_expert.Recursive}Recursive} - an interface to a
        recursive descent algorithm.

  (** {2:sema Semantic Analysis}
      This part of the library is currently under heavy
      construction. We will provide information later.  *)


  (** {2:project Writing Program Analysis Plugins}

      To write a program analysis plugin you need to implement a
      function with one of the following interfaces:

      - [project -> project] and register it with
        {{!Project.register_plugin}register_plugin};
      - [project -> unit] and register it with
         {{!Project.register_plugin'}register_plugin'};
      - [string array -> project -> project] and register it with
        {{!Project.register_plugin_with_args}register_plugin_with_args};
      - [string array -> project -> unit] and register it with
        {{!Project.register_plugin_with_args'}register_plugin_with_args'}.

      Once loaded from the [bap] utility (see [man bap]) this function
      will be invoked with a value of type {{!Project.t}project} that
      provides access to all information gathered over the binary so
      far. If the registered function returns a non [unit] type, then it 
      can functionally update the project state, e.g., add
      annotations, discover new symbols, make corrections, and even
      change the architecture and re-disassemble everything.

      {3 Exchanging information}

      For exchanging information in a type safe manner, we use
      {{!Tag}universal values}. Values can be attached to a
      particular memory region, or to a key of type [string]. For the
      first case we use the {{!Memmap}memmap} data structure. It is
      an interval tree containing all the memory regions that are
      used during analysis. For the latter a regular [String.Map] is
      used.

      {3 Annotating memory}

      Depending on the analysis performed and input parameters, one can
      expect that memory may be annotated with the following tags:

      - [Image.region] -- for regions of memory that had a
      particular name in the original binary. For example, in ELF,
      sections have names that annotate a corresponding memory
      region.

      - [Image.section] -- if the binary data was loaded from a binary
      format that contains sections (aka segments), then the
      corresponding memory regions are be marked. Sections provide
      access to permission information.

      - [Image.symbol] -- with this tag we annotate each memory region
      that belongs to a particular symbol. Currently, the type of
      this tag is a string.
  *)


  (** {2:aux Auxiliary libraries}

      {3:dwarf DWARF library}

      The Dwarf library provides an access to DWARF debugging
      information. It implements parsing of some subset of DWARF
      features, and a high-level interface {{!Dwarf.Fbi}Fbi} that
      extracts function symbols from the given DWARF data.

      {3:sigs Byteweight}

      This {{!Byteweight}library} implements a byteweight algorithm
      that identifies functions in stripped binaries, as well as
      being able to train itself on a provided training corpus.

  (** {1:api BAP API}  *)

  (** ['a printer] defines a type for pretty-printers for a value of
      type ['a]. This is the type, that is required by [%a] specifier,
      for [Format.printf]-family of functions. Also, this is the type,
      that can be installed into OCaml toplevel or debugger.

  (** Bitvector -- a type for representing binary values.

      {2 Overview }

      A numeric value with a 2-complement binary representation. It is
      good for representing addresses, offsets and other numeric values.

      Each value is attributed by a its bit-width. All arithmetic
      operations over values are done modulo their widths. It is an
      error to apply arithmetic operation to values with different
      widths. Default implementations will raise a [Width] exception,
      however there exists a family of modules that provide arithmetic
      operations lifted to an [Or_error.t] monad. It is suggested to use
      them, if you know what kind of operands you're expecting.


      {2 Clarifications endianness and bit-ordering }

      Bitvector should be considered as an number with an arbitrary
      width. That means, that as with all numbers it is subject to
      endianness. When we iterate over bitvector using some container
      interface we always start from the byte with the lower
      address. Depending on endianness it will be either least
      significant bytes (little-endian), or most significant
      (big-endian). Sometimes id does matter, sometimes it doesn't. In a
      latter case you can just use a default native-endian
      interface. But in a former case, please consider using explicit
      modules, either [Bytes_LE] or [Bytes_BE], even if you know that
      your system is [LE]. Things change.

      Bits are always numbered from right to left, with least
      significant bit having a zero index, and most significant having
      index equal to [width - 1]. That means, they're endianness
      agnostic.

      {2 Clarification on size-morphism }

      Size-monomorphic operations (as opposed to size-polymorphic
      comparison) doesn't allow to compare two operands with different
      sizes, and either raise exception or return [Error]. If we would
      have type safe interface, with type [t] defined as [type 'a t],
      where ['a] stands for size, then size-monomorphic operations will
      have type ['a t -> 'a t -> _], and size-polymorphic ['a t -> 'b t -> _].

      By default, size-polymorphic comparison is used (for rationale of
      this decision look at the implementation of a hash function). To
      understand the ordering relation one can think that a lexical
      ordering is specified on a tuple [(x,n)], where [x] is the number
      and [n] is the size. For example, the following sequence is in an
      ascending order:

      {[ 0x0:1, 0x0:32, 0x0:64, 0x1:1, 0x1:32, 0xD:4, 0xDEADBEEF:32]}.

      A size-monomorphic interfaced is exposed in a [Mono] submodule. So
      if you want a monomorphic map, then just use [Mono.Map] module.
      Note, [Mono] submodule doesn't provide [Table], since we cannot
      guarantee that all keys in a hash-table have equal size.

      {2 Clarification on signs}

      By default all numbers represented by a bitvector are considered
      unsigned. This includes comparisons, e.g., [of_int (-1) ~width:32]
      is greater than zero. If you need to perform signed operation, you
      can use [signed] operator to temporary cast your value to signed.
      We use temporary to emphasize that, the signedness property won't
      propagate to the result of the operation, e.g. result of the
      following expression: [Int_exn.(signed x / y)] will not be signed.

      If any operand of a binary operation is signed, then a signed
      version of an operation is used.

      Remember to use explicit casts, whenever you really need a signed
      representation. Examples:
      {[
        let x = of_int ~-6 ~width:8
        let y = to_int x          (* y = 250 *)
        let z = to_int (signed x) (* z = ~-6 *)
        let zero = of_int 0 ~width:8
        let p = x < zero          (* p = false *)
        let q = signed x < zero   (* p = true *)
      ]}

      {2 Clarification on string representation }

      As a part of [Identifiable] interface bitvector provides a pair of
      complement functions: [to_string] and [of_string], that provides
      facilities to store bitvector as a human readable string, and to
      restore it from string. The format of the representation is the
      following (in EBNF):
      {[
        repr  = [sign], base, digit, {digit}, ":", size | true | false;
        sign  = "+" | "-";
        base  = "0x" | "0b" | "0o";
        size  = dec, {dec};
        digit = dec | oct | hex;
        dec   = ?decimal digit?;
        oct   = ?octal digit?;
        hex   = ?hexadecimal digit?;
      ]}

      Examples:
      [0x5D:32, 0b0101:16, 5:64, +5:8, +0x5D:16, true, false.].

      Form [false] is a shortcut for [0:1], as well as [true] is [1:1].

      If [base] is omitted base-10 is assumed. The output format is
      lways ["0x", hex, {hex}] in an unsigned form. *)

    (** Visitor.
        Visits AST providing lots of hooks.

        For each AST constructor [C] the visitor provides three methods:
        [enter_C], [visit_C], [leave_C]. The default implementation for
        [enter_C] and [leave_C] is to return its argument. The default
        implementation for [visit_C] is the following:
        1. call [enter_C]
        2. visit all children
        3. call [leave_C].

        It is recommended to override [enter_C] method if you only need
        to visit [C] constructor without changing a way you're visiting
        the tree.

        For example, to collect all resolved jumps one could write the
        following function:

        {[
          let collect_calls bil = (object(self)
            inherit [Word.t list] visitor
            method! enter_int x js = if in_jmp then x :: js else js
          end)#run bil []
        ]}

         The default entry point of the visitor is method [run], but
         you can use any other method as well, for example, if you do
         not have a statement at all and want to visit expression.

      To extend variant type with a new constructor, use

      [Tag.register constructor_name sexp_of_constructor], where

      constructor name can be any name, and can even clash with previous
      definitions it is guaranteed, that you will receive a new
      representation of the constructor, every time you're calling this
      function even if parameters are the same. The returned value is
      supposed to be exposed in a module, for later use in other
      modules, c.f., {{!Image}Image} module defines three constructors:
      - [Image.symbol] for Image symbols, that basically can be seen as
      [Image.Symbol of sym]
      - [Image.section] for image sections;
      - [Image.region] for other named image memory regions. *)

      caching underneath the hood, so that they perform better if
      they're  build once and used many times.

      Tables can be also linked. For example, if you have two tables

    (** [link relation t t1 t2] takes two tables and returns a mapping

        Parameter [t] specifies a [hashable] typeclass of the type ['a]. If
        type ['a] implements [Hashable] interface, then you can obtain it
        with [hashable] function, e.g. [Int.hashable] with return the
        appropriate type class. If ['a] doesn't implement [Hashable], then
        it can be implemented manually.

        Relation specifies the multiplicity of the relation between
        entities from table [t1] to entities from table [t2], and is
        summarized below:

        - [one_to_many] means that a particular region from table [t1] can
        span several memory regions from table [t2]. Example: segments
        to symbols relation.

        - [one_to_one] means that for each value of type ['a] there is
        exactly one value of type ['b]. This relation should be used with
        caution, since it is quantified over _all_ values of type
        ['a]. Indeed, it should be used only for cases, when it can be
        guaranteed, that it is impossible to create such value of type
        ['b], that has no correspondence in table [t2]. Otherwise,
        [one_to_maybe_one] relation should be used. Example: llvm
        machine code to assembly string relation.

        - [one_to_maybe_one] means that for each value in table [t1] there
        exists at most one value in table [t2]. Example: function to
        symbol relation.

    (** [rev_map arity t tab] creates a reverse mapping from values of
        typeclass [t] stored in table [tab] to memory regions.

        Note. not every mapping is reversable, for example, trying to obtain
        a reverse of surjective mapping as a one-to-one mapping will
        result in an error. But surjective mappings can be reversed
        using [~one_to:many] mapping. A particular example of surjective
        mapping is [symbol] tables, in a case when functions can occupy
        several non-contiguous regions of memory.

        For example, to create a mapping from a function symbol to
        sequence of memory regions with it code:

        {[rev_map one_to:many Sym.hashable tab]}

    (** {2 Iterators}

        This section provides a common set of iterators. Note: name
        iterator is used in a functional meaning, i.e., an iterator is a
        function that takes a data structure and another function, and
        applies it to all elements in some manner.

        All iterators share some common part of interface that was lifted
        to a ['a ranged] type. When you see

        [('a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> bool) ranged]

        just mentally substitute it with:

        [?start -> ?until -> 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> bool].

        In other words ['f ranged] just prepends [?start -> ?until ->] to
        function with type ['f] (do not forget that ['f] can be an arrow
        type).

        [start] and [until] parameters allows to narrow iteration to some
        subset of table. If they are unspecified then iteration would be
        performed on all table entries in an ascending order of
        addresses. If they are specified, then if [start <= until], then
        iteration will be performed in the same order but on a specified
        subset. In the case, when [start > until], iteration will be
        performed in a decreasing order.

          information that might be useful. Although, since storing it
          takes extra time and space, it is disabled by default.

          The first type variable specifies whether storing assembly strings
          is enabled. It can be switched using [store_asm], [drop_asm]
          functions. When it is enabled, then this type variable will be set

          this information. Otherwise, this type variable will be set to
          [empty], thus stopping you from accessing assembler information.

          The second type variable stands for [kinds], i.e. to store or not to
          store extra information about instruction kind.

      (** [run ?stop_on ?invalid ?stopped dis mem ~init ~return ~hit]
          performs recursive disassembly of specified memory [mem]. The
          process of disassembly can be driven using [stop], [step], [back]
          and [jump] functions, described later.

          @param stop_on defines a set of predicates that will be checked
          on each step to decide whether it should stop here and call a
          user-provided [hit] function, or it should continue. The descision
          is made acording to the rule: [if exists stop_on then stop], i.e.,
          it there exists such predicate in a set of predicates, that
          evaluates to true, then stop the disassembly and pass the control
          to the user function [hit].  A few notes: only valid instructions
          can match predicates, and if the set is empty, then it always
          evaluates to false.

          @param init initial value of user data, that can be passed
          through handlers (cf., [fold])

          @param return a function that lifts user data type ['s] to type
          ['r]. It is useful when you need to perform disassembly in some
          monad, like [Or_error], or [Lwt]. Otherwise, just use [ident]
          function and assume that ['s == 'r].

          In a process of disassembly user provided callbacks are invoked by
          the engine. To each callback at least two parameters are passed:
          [state] and [user_data]. [user_data] is arbitrary data of type ['s]
          with which the folding over the memory is actually
          performed. [state] incapsulates the current state of the
          disassembler, and provides continuation functions, namely [stop],
          [next] and [back], that drives the process of disassembly. This
          functions are used to pass control back to the disassembler.

          [stopped state user_data] is called when there is no more data to
          disassemble. This handler is optional and defaults to [stop].

          [invalid state user_data] is an optional handler that is called on
          each invalid instruction (i.e., a portion of data that is not a
          valid instruction), it defaults to [step], i.e., to skipping.

          [hit state mem insn data] is called when one of the predicates
          specifed by a user was hit. [insn] is actually the instruction
          that satisfies the predicate. [mem] is a memory region spanned by
          the instruction. [data] is a user data. [insn] can be queried for
          assembly string and kinds even if the corresponding modes are
